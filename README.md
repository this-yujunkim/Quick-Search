## 📝 About This Project

I wanted to learn web programming while working on a real-world project. 
I decided to create a Chrome extension, which I thought would be relatively easy. 
However, I didn't know how to create a Chrome extension from scratch, 
so I watched YouTube videos and used AI agents (also known as vibe coding) 
to create the basis of my program. I hope this project will help me improve 
my coding and software engineering skills, and make me more interested in CS.
