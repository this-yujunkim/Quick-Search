## 📝 About This Project

I wanted to study web programming by working on a real project. But to make a website seemed to hard for me. So I decided to create a Chrome extension, which I thought would be relatively easy. But, I had no idea how to start making Chrome extentions from scratch. So I watched some youtube videos and used AI agents (vibe coded) to make the foundation of the program.
